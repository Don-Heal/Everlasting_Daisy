            I'm a mother of two beautiful boys, Drew and Zane. I have a love for
            the creative arts and have always enjoyed creating things for my
            family. I am an Early Childhood Teacher but in my spare time use
            creativity and imagination to make products for our business.

            I have a love for graphic design and anything creative. I am a Vet
            Nurse but spend a lot of my time designing and creating new products
            that are homemade for the business.
